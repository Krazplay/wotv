First I've heard of it.","030":"I intend for us to storm the fortress and eliminate Lu'Cia.","031":"The bounty goes to the one who brings her down.","032":"A bounty...

Make your choice.","037":"The enemy is a remarkable marksman...","038":"But if another group became her target, the others would be able to move in closer...","039":"Then cutting her down shouldn't be that difficult.","040":"Commander... You're going with us, right?","041":"I've said it before. Glahz and I are different.","042":"Then...I'm going. If we rush in all at once—","043":"Right.

The commander of «Nitor», Adelard, right?","006":"The Vermilion Devil... So you used your own comrades as decoys to get this far.","007":"Calling them \"decoys\" is regrettable. If life is truly so precious, then one should not step foot on the battlefield.","008":"......","009":"The motivation behind this attack was neither to take this fortress nor to take out Hourne soldiers.

Your brother looks more handsome than ever, yes?","016":"You look great, Howlie!","017":"You came here for the blade, no?","018":"Was there truly a need for you to acquire a whole new set of clothes as well?","019":"I simply listened to the voice calling out to me, urging me to realize my potential.","020":"I'm not even going to pretend I understand what you're talking about...","021":"So, what about the blade?","022":"Ah, yes...the sword I was tasked to find by Master. Consider it found.","023":"The old man asked you to search for it?","024":"But I thought he renounced you as a student...","025":"Renounced me? Ah, I was just jesting about that.","026":"You deceived us? But for whatever purpose?","027":"Howlie! You lied to us!","028":"Listen here, Chel. A lie is not necessarily a bad thing.","029":"It isn't?","030":"Suppose that we had promised to meet each other here.","031":"Of course, I can scarcely wait to see my dear sister. So I arrive far ahead of time.","032":"Oh, Howlie! That would make me so happy!","033":"So eventually, you show up. And you ask me...","034":"\"Hey, Howlie! Did I keep you waiting long?\"","035":"Yeah! I just might ask that!","036":"Now, suppose I said, \"Indeed you did, Chel. I was waiting for you forever and ever!\" How would you feel then?","037":"I'd be so happy! After all, my dear brother waited for me forever and ever!","038":"Er, right...","039":"And yet!

You know that!","041":"Well, uh...yes, I suppose.","042":"Looks like Chel got you on this one, Brother.","043":"Now, can you tell us about the blade?","044":"Indeed, but not here. I shall tell you more about it on the road.","045":"Is it something that must be kept secret?","046":"Not as such.

Did you not know that Master was once a great swordsmith himself?","025":"What!? I'd never heard such a thing.","026":"Master forged the blade for a great samurai from the east and bestowed it upon him.

Lend your blade so that we may save him.","134":"...I suppose I can't refuse if it means we could learn something.","135":"I'll have this wrapped up shortly. Just don't get in the way, got it?","136":"As you say!"},"l_evnt_01_01_1_04c":{"137":"...They were quite tougher than I anticipated. Ferocious, even, just as the villagers said.","138":"Wh-who are you?","139":"Warriors of the Crystals. We aided you in the hope of you knowing something useful.","140":"Warriors of the Crystals...?","141":"A-allow me! She means we came here in search of something.","142":"But more important than that, how do you fare?","143":"F-fine, thanks to you two.","144":"I really appreciate the help.","145":"But what if you're actually assassins who only saved me in order to lower my guard...?","146":"Lower your blade, Tyrrell.","147":"V-Vinera. You shouldn't come out here.","148":"For all we know, they could be Fennes assassins!","149":"It's all right. You needn't worry about these two.","150":"H-how can you tell!?","151":"They mean us no harm. Though I am in no condition to fight at the moment, I can still sense that much.","152":"If Vinera says you're okay...","153":"Then I just turned my blade on the people who saved me. My apologies.","154":"I'm Tyrrell. Circumstances have forced Vinera on the road, and I've been accompanying her ever since. ","155":"As he said, my name is Vinera.","156":"Firstly, allow me to express my gratitude. Thank you for helping us.","157":"Now, then. What has brought you here?","158":"We're looking for a Core Crystal.","159":"...Let me give you a more detailed explanation.","160":"...And here we are.","161":"So you're traveling in search of Crystals that have been strewn about to different lands...","162":"It's quite difficult to believe...especially about your realm.","163":"To continue, do you have any information regarding the Core Crystal?","164":"Sorry to disappoint you, but I do not.","165":"I see. Then we're off.","166":"A-a moment! That decision was made a bit too hastily!","167":"We have no time to waste.","168":"Why do you only see things based on their efficiency, Lady Jeume?","169":"Ahem. I will be the one asking questions for the time being.","170":"Why are you two in this tunnel? I assume you're running from someone?","171":"Well...","172":"Our homeland is out to take our lives.","173":"V-Vinera!?","174":"We've heard what brought them here. Is it not fair for us to share as well?","175":"I guess you're right...","176":"We took refuge in these mines to escape our pursuers from Fennes.","177":"The vicious monsters proved to be too great in number, however, so we have been unable to advance any farther...","178":"...Which leads me to a proposition.","179":"Would you escort us through the mines?","180":"Wh-what are you saying!? I'm the only escort you need...","181":"Tyrrell... We cannot afford any chance of being caught.","182":"So would it not be better to have as many people guarding us as possible?","183":"What keeps you from fighting as well, Lady Vinera?","184":"Vinera is carrying a child.","185":"So she can't fight. Even if she wanted to, I wouldn't let her.","186":"Can't fight...? Then what purpose does the sword on your hip serve?","187":"...Someone very dear to me entrusted me with it.","188":"I think of it as a lucky charm.","189":"So that's how you ended up here... What should we do, Lady Jeume?","190":"We don't have the time for detours.","191":"Even more so, I can't take part in something as inefficient as protecting the weak.","192":"Of course, I would not ask without offering something in return. We shall help you find the Core Crystal.","193":"If you think it might be in the mines somewhere, would it not make sense to have as many people looking for it as possible?","194":"Since they've offered to help us, the least we could do is escort them, don't you think?","195":"I don't understand why we would guard a burden such as Vinera.","196":"Escorting them means putting ourselves at risk.","197":"I don't find it necessary to endanger myself for the sake of others.","198":"I'm inexperienced as a Warrior of the Crystals, and it may not mean much coming from someone who is not human...","199":"But humans do not live their lives based solely on what they might lose or gain.","200":"Moreover, I can't just leave them to fend for themselves.","201":"Not as a Warrior of the Crystals, but as the being that I am...","202":"...Just answer one thing.","203":"Do you think there is meaning in the strong protecting the weak?","204":"I cannot say.","205":"But I do know that if I fail to offer my assistance in this moment, I'll live to regret it later.","206":"...All right.","207":"We'll heed your request.","208":"But only until we find the Crystal. Agreed?","209":"Of course. You have my thanks.","210":"...We could always use you as bait if things take a turn, after all.","211":"Hey, Vinera? Maybe these were the wrong people to ask for help after all...","212":"H-hahaha..."},"l_evnt_01_01_1_06c":{"213":"*Huff, huff* The monsters just keep coming!","214":"A Warrior of the Crystals does not moan about such trifling enemies. ","215":"...Apologies. ","216":"First things first, you should stop charging ahead blindly. You are wide open to your foes and it is painful to watch.","217":"Find the enemy's weakness as you fight. Your mind is as important as your blade in battle. Use it and you can become stronger.","218":"R-right!","219":"If you really understand, then let us hurry on ahead. I said get going.","220":"...Gods, I'm happy I ended up traveling with someone like you, Vinera.","221":"Perhaps I should start being more strict with you, too?","222":"P-please, not that...","223":"Ahaha...you two seem quite close.","224":"Y-you think so?","225":"Are you in love with Vinera?","226":"Lady Jeume! Try to read the room a little!","227":"Did I say something wrong?","228":"...Not quite. Vinera is very precious to me.","229":"Not just Vinera, but the baby she carries, as well.","230":"And most of all, Lord Dario had a great impact on me as well.","231":"Lord Dario...who is that?","232":"Vinera's husband. Though he is no longer with us...","233":"I see...","234":"And so you risk your life for a woman whom you shall never be with?","235":"Lord Dario asked me to look after her. Besides, I don't want to see someone so important to me get hurt.","236":"Humans are curious creatures. I cannot comprehend them.","237":"Though the thought may cross your mind, must you say it aloud?","238":"The monsters are increasing in strength and number as we advance. Could it be that there's something up ahead?","239":"Lady Jeume, is this...?","240":"A sign that the Crystal is close. I sense it even more keenly than before.","241":"Wh-what's happening!?","242":"Hold on to me, Vinera!","243":"Th-the path...! We're blocked in!","244":"Meaning there is no going back.","245":"It matters not—our business lies ahead.","246":"But we don't know what may happen. Be ready for battle.","246_1":"Grrr...","247":"L-look at the size of it...!","248":"I sense the Crystal from within the monster's body.","249":"If I had to guess, I would say it swallowed the Core Crystal.","250":"Th-that means this monster is the reason why...","251":"Indeed. It appears this is the cause of the other monsters' enhanced aggression.","252":"I don't really follow, but we should slay this thing, right?","253":"I'm glad you reached that conclusion so quickly. In any case, we can't leave this tunnel until it has been felled.","254":"Stay back, Vinera. We'll handle this thing!","254_1":"Graaah!","255":"Here it comes!"},"l_evnt_01_01_1_08c":{"256":"It's no use!","257":"Ngh... I guess swallowing the Crystal affected more than just its size!","258":"At this rate, we'll—!","259":"Lord Tyrrell!","260":"Gahhh!","261":"A-are you all right!?","262":"Never are you to let your focus falter during battle. Concentrate on the enemy before you.","263":"G-got it...!","264":"Enhanced by the Crystal it may be, it is still a mere monster.","265":"It has to have some kind of weakness!","266":"No...!","267":"Vinera!","268":"L-Lord Dario's sword lit up and repelled the monster's attack...!?","269":"Get away from her!","270":"Vinera, are you hurt?","271":"I-I am fine. Lord Dario's sword protected me...","272":"This light is...quite odd. It feels so warm, yet I also feel some kind of loneliness from it too...","273":"Whoa!","274":"...Tyrrell. Vinera is in your care now.","275":"Huh!? This voice...!","276":"Voice...? Can you hear something, Tyrrell?","277":"...Okay...I understand, Lord Dario.","278":"This light is Lord Dario's love... His very spirit which cherishes Vinera!","279":"You can count on me, Lord Dario! I'll protect her no matter what!","280":"If you're injured, withdraw. Otherwise you're nothing more than a burden.","281":"You mean this? This is nothing!","282":"Besides, if I don't rise to the challenge now, I'd never be able to face Lord Dario again.","283":"Though you should be at your limit, I feel your vigor is only rising.","284":"...Curious.","285":"Lucio!","286":"Y-yes?","287":"While we engage the monster, use that opportunity to pinpoint its weakness.","288":"Y-you think I can do that?","289":"It's not a matter of can or cannot. If you don't, we lose here.","290":"Our duty is to protect the Crystals.","291":"The first step to fulfilling that duty is felling this beast.","292":"So show me. Show me you can pass through the threshold into Warriorhood!","293":"R-right! I'll give it a shot!","294":"Tyrrell. Show us the power of your heart.","295":"Got it. You can count on me!","296":"Lord Dario..."},"l_evnt_01_01_2_99":{"297":"W-we did it!

Core Crystal collected.","302":"...Could you at least wipe that blood and gunk off?","303":"Why bother? If you have such a problem with it, wipe it yourself.","304":"Is there any damage to the Core Crystal?","305":"The surface is a bit dirty, but I see no abnormalities with the Core Crystal itself.","306":"So that's the Core Crystal you two have been looking for?","307":"It's instrumental in keeping this world in balance. I'm relieved we were able to retrieve it.","308":"And Lucio...","309":"You did well.","310":"...What? C-could it be you're actually...commending me?","311":"...It won't happen again.","312":"Our task is complete. We'll be leaving here shortly. I suggest you two do the same.","313":"...Though I suppose it won't hurt to continue escorting you until we reach the exit.","314":"What do you think brought on this change of heart?","315":"I'm fairly sure she's taken a liking to you both.","316":"...Phew. It looks like we've finally made it out.","317":"Since the tunnel is blocked, we should have a moment of respite from our pursuers.","318":"What happened with your sword earlier, anyway?","319":"It looks like a typical sword to me.","320":"This is Lord Dario's favorite blade.","321":"Though it seems to have lost its magic...","322":"I have no doubt it was Lord Dario's will that protected Vinera back there.","323":"Lord Dario...","324":"I want to thank you both once again. We could not have made it without your escort.","325":"Thanks to you as well. We wouldn't have recovered the Crystal without you two.","326":"......","327":"What's with that face?","328":"N-nothing. I just never thought I would see you thank someone.","329":"...Once we return, I have a special lesson planned just for you.","330":"W-wait a moment. Don't tell me you're upset...","331":"Hehe. Do go easy on him.","332":"Well, then. I believe it's time for us to press on.","333":"W-wait!","334":"What will you do now?","335":"Well...once we've escaped our pursuers for good, I hope to live out a peaceful life...","336":"Together with my child, without strife.","337":"I want to give her a life without any burdens to bear.","338":"Because...in this world, nothing is more precious than freedom.","339":"That is the dream Lord Dario and I shared.","340":"And I'll be there to protect Vinera and her child, no need to worry.","341":"If anyone can do it, you can. You have the strength for it.","342":"Thanks! Until next time!","343":"We should head back as well. We must prepare for your training.","344":"...So you really were upset earlier?","345":"Not at all. I just want to whip you into fighting shape, seeing how unskilled you currently are.","346":"So you were mad!","347":"Enough. We're leaving.

My win again.","008":"I should have known, Lady Jeume... It's going to take an eternity before I can hope to beat you.","009":"No excuses. We will not have a weakling amongst the Warriors of the Crystals.","010":"Gah... I know...","011":"Surely it wouldn't kill you to be a little nicer to him.","012":"...Cetia. What are you doing here?","013":"Would you believe me if I said I came to meet the promising new recruit?","014":"All you'll find here is a novice who has yet to land a blow on me. Not even once.","015":"You think so? I for one think he has potential. I mean, he's putting up with your grueling training quite admirably, right?","016":"Those who don't give up so easily are all right in my book!","017":"Less whining would be nice, mind you.","018":"Nothing in life is impossible, after all!","019":"Talkative as always... And? Why are you really here?","020":"The second Core Crystal. I thought I'd have the new recruit help me find it!","021":"I believe you could retrieve it more aptly on your own. Lucio still requires further training.","022":"L-Lady Jeume...","023":"But I'm the one who decides that, not you, Jeume!","024":"Or perhaps you were hoping to keep him all to yourself?","025":"...Fine. If it would keep you from needlessly misconstruing my intentions, he's all yours.","026":"I knew you'd come around if we just talked it out, Jeume!","027":"Now... Lucio, was it?","028":"Y-yes. I'm Lucio, the warrior in training.","029":"You've got spirit, so I think we'll get along just fine! But let's talk work, Lucio.","030":"You and I are going to find the second Core Crystal!","031":"Let's get going!","032":"N-now!? Could I maybe have a break first...?","033":"You'll be fine! Mind over body—just push through it!","034":"We're off, Lucio! To the continent of Ardra!","035":"Don't I get a say in this!? H-hey!","036":"Lake as far as the eye can see, and not a way to cross it...","037":"*Sigh* Will we ever reach Ovis?","038":"And to think that I, Lord Camillo, am all but ready to gallantly come to the rescue.","039":"...Heavens, their poor hearts are likely not prepared to resist this kind of chivalry.","040":"Forgive me, unmet beauties! I only have eyes for Machérie...","041":"You want to get to Ovis as soon as possible too, right?","042":"......","043":"Elsirelle?","044":"Zzzzzz...","045":"Sleeping again!? It must be nice, living life without a care like that...","046":"*Yawn* ...There are no monsters here, so my senses lulled a bit. Were you saying something just now?","047":"Yes, about how we're going to save Ovis and turn Machérie's affections in my direction.","048":"So same old, same old. I regret waking up just for that.","049":"Are you always so grumpy when you first wake—hm?","050":"What is it? Are you getting sleepy, too?","051":"That problem only applies to you. Anyway, there's something odd on the ground over there.","052":"Whoa...look at the size of it. I've never seen a crystal so huge.","053":"Someone probably fell asleep and left it here.","054":"I told you, that problem only applies to you.","055":"Regardless, it is rather peculiar. Denser than common crystals...and quite lustrous to boot.","056":"Hmm...I imagine this would fetch a fine price. It's not like we have any other prospects at the moment, so why not put it towards our travels?","057":"It might be someone's lost property.","058":"I don't see their name on it. I doubt they would be able to find it again, anyway.","059":"Besides, we need to buy ourselves a boat if we want to reach Ovis...","060":"And neither of us have that kind of gil at the moment.","061":"Which is why we should sell it and at least try to break even.","062":"...You always make perfect sense when you have something to gain from it.","063":"Come on, I deserve more credit than that! We finally have a chance of crossing the lake to Ovis!","064":"...Hmph. I'll keep it with me. Knowing you, you're likely to drop it as soon as you fall asleep.","065":"Quite a rude assumption to make. I wouldn't do something like that...probably.","066":"Says the person who slept through a pivotal moment in her nation's history.","067":"Anyway, it's about time we got out of this forest.","068":"...The next time you fall asleep, I'm going on without you. Got it?","069":"Worry not. A master such as myself can follow on even when in slumber's warm embrace.","070":"You can fall asleep on your feet and keep walking?","071":"So many people appear to be armed.","072":"Dressed like that...I'm guessing they're mercenaries. This region is probably at war.","073":"War, you say...","074":"Speaking of which, I've never really understood it.","075":"If they would only speak with each other, I'm sure they would come to an understanding!","076":"Hahaha...","077":"Regardless, having so many people here will make gathering information much easier.","078":"Gathering information, huh...","079":"How do you plan to go about it?","080":"By asking each person individually, of course...","081":"Plan rejected!","082":"What...?","083":"Wait there, new recruit.","084":"Let me show you the most efficient way to gather information!","500":"*Inhale* ","085":"Has anyone here seen a Core Crystal!?","086":"It's crimson! If that rings a bell, come talk to me on the double!","087":"L-Lady Cetia!? You shouldn't draw so much attention like that!","088":"Why talk to them one by one when we could get this sorted out in a jiff?","089":"That may be so, but to those who have no frame of reference, you must sound mad!","090":"It won't be easy to find someone to speak with us now that they're wary of us...","091":"Hello, gorgeous. Did I hear you say you're looking for a crimson crystal?","092":"I might be able to help you with that. Would you be so kind as to accompany us for a bit?","093":"See? I told you, new recruit! How easy was that?","094":"I-I truly didn't expect anyone to come forward.","095":"Listen here, Camillo. I won't be dragged into yet another one of your impulsive flirtations.","096":"Hey, now. I'm Machérie's man. This is absolutely NOTHING but business.","097":"Anyway, can you please be quiet? I'm making some headway here.","098":"But what is there to discuss other than returning that crystal?","099":"H-hey! Shhh!","100":"You two have the Core Crystal!?","101":"Whether or not it's a Core Crystal, I cannot say. But we did find a crimson crystal in the forest.","102":"I believe he's tucked it away in his pocket.","103":"E-Elsirelle!","104":"Oh, so you've found it! You don't know how much time and effort you've saved us! Now, if you could just hand it over...","105":"Not so fast. First things first, could you explain what exactly this is?","106":"I have no other way of knowing if this really belongs to you, after all.","107":"Sure, no problem! New recruit, I'll let you give them the details.","108":"Oh, so that's where I come in...","109":"...And that's the gist of it.","110":"So the Core Crystals maintain the balance of the universe, huh...","111":"Which is why we're so relieved that you found it, Lord Camillo.","112":"...Don't get ahead of yourself. I can't just give it up and walk away empty-handed.","113":"What!?","114":"Now, Camillo. Why not return it?","115":"Have you forgotten already? We have to reach Ovis.","116":"And to do so, we need a boat. And to get a boat, we need the Crystal to make some gil.","117":"If we hand it over, we'll be back where we started with no way to get to Ovis.","118":"That is true, but...","119":"It is for this reason I'd like to make a proposition...","120":"Would you be willing to buy this off of me?","121":"If not, then perhaps you'd be willing to help us earn some gil.","122":"Just enough to buy a boat, then the Crystal is yours. Not a bad deal, right?","123":"What shall we do, Lady Cetia?","124":"We accept your deal!","125":"Huh!? Shouldn't you give it some more thought?","126":"The Crystal belongs to them now. It has from the moment they found it.","127":"We have no right to take it from them by force, either.","128":"That... That might be true, but the universe will fall out of balance if we don't get the Core Crystal back.","129":"Despite such high stakes, I feel you're awfully unconcerned...","130":"And the universe would mean nothing without the people in it! You can't truly have harmony without trust!","131":"Ugh, how are you so optimistic?","132":"By the way we're completely broke, so we may as well get to work!","133":"Gah, such a radiant smile for someone without a single gil to their name!","134":"All we have to do is make some gil and we can get the Core Crystal back.","135":"A peaceful resolution is the best we could have hoped for!","136":"...Very well. Perhaps you do have a point, Lady Cetia.","137":"Then it's settled. Elsirelle and I appreciate the help.","138":"Now that we are of the same mind, let us look for work in the nearby village.","139":"There's plenty available during wartimes. I suppose we could take on some easy quests and do it slow and steady.","140":"Understood. I look forward to working with the both of you!","141":"All right, now we're talking! I am ready to get things done!"},"l_evnt_01_02_1_02c":{"142":"Okay, time to get to work. I've scoped out some jobs that should earn us a fair amount in little time.","143":"First up is...this. It appears that monsters are on the move after their habitats were burned out.","144":"Based on what the lookout said, their path will lead them directly through this village.","145":"Our quest is to fell the monsters.","146":"Nice and simple! I bet I could handle this on my own!","147":"Is that so? I look forward to seeing how you and your bow deal with a pack of monsters.","148":"I'll be happy to show you!","149":"But are you two capable of handling something like this?","150":"I'll have you know that we're quite masterful in battle.","151":"With that confidence, it would be fine if I opted to sleep, no?","152":"I said \"we,\" didn't I!? Stop looking for chances to sleep!","153":"I was obviously joking.","154":"It hardly sounds that way when it comes from you.","155":"Oh, here they come.","156":"Grawwwr!","157":"Is it just me or do their eyes have a...glow to them?","158":"Lady Cetia, could it be...?","159":"It must be the influence of the Core Crystal.","160":"Exposure to the Core Crystal's magic has caused them to become ravenous.","161":"Just like in the mines! Everyone, please take caution!","162":"H-hey, you didn't say anything about the Crystal having this kind of effect!","163":"What's past is past! Everyone, prepare for battle!","164":"Dammit, I guess there's no way out of this one! Elsirelle, back me up!","165":"Zzzzzz...","166":"She's actually sleeping!? That wasn't a joke earlier!?","167":"She must be awfully fearless to fall asleep at a time like this! I like her already!","168":"*Yawn* ...Are we done talking yet?","169":"You can fight just after waking up?","170":"Naturally. My style of sleep is more like a concentration of the mind. And my mind has been honed to perfect working order.","171":"What's more, it is a knight's calling to protect the people. A duty for which I am always ready.","172":"I like how you think! We'll get along just fine!","173":"So, how about a friendly competition? Whoever downs the most monsters wins!","174":"I accept. I shall etch the sight of my skills into your memory for all eternity.","175":"C-can't we just work together?","176":"Give it up, Lucio. There's no getting through to them now.","177":"Besides, we're about to be busy ourselves!"},"l_evnt_01_02_1_04c":{"178":"You've done a great service for us! As promised, here's your payment.","179":"Phew...so the Core Crystal was causing the monsters to become aggressive. This job was not good for the heart...","180":"My apologies. We should have told you first.","181":"Well, they sweetened the pay because of the extra danger, so I guess it all worked out in the end.","182":"But we still don't have enough, not even close. Let's move on to the next job.","183":"What does the next one entail?","184":"It should be much easier than the last one. No matter how you look at it, it's just collecting materials.","185":"Antidotes are said to be in short supply due to the war.","186":"So our task is to go to the nearby woods and track down some medicinal herbs and snake venom.","187":"Sounds like honest work to me! My legs could use the workout, so it's a win-win!","188":"The forest... Should be a good place for a nap, especially in this nice weather.","189":"No, you'll be working, too. No messing around.","190":"...I have yet to see a single snake.","191":"I'm having no trouble finding herbs, though. Could it be that the monsters spooked them into their dens?","192":"If you have time to complain, you have time to keep looking, new recruit! Just put in the effort and you'll find them!","193":"Your superior is awfully strict.","194":"Hahaha... The fault lies in my lack of discipline...","195":"Man to man, I think you ought to have a bit more confidence.","196":"Fine ladies don't give unconfident men the time of day.","197":"Though Lady Machérie does not give it to presumptuous men, either.","198":"O-oh, be quiet! Once we save Ovis, I'll become a man worthy of Machérie!","199":"Hmph... Still no snakes to be found. Time for a breather.","200":"Hmm? I think there's some kind of hole where you're sitting...","201":"Huh?","202":"Gah! There's snakes coming out of it!","203":"Why would their den be in a place like this!?","204":"C-calm down! If you don't provoke them, they should leave you alone!","205":"Lucio! There's one around your feet!","206":"Whoa!","207":"Look out!","208":"You fell pretty hard. Are you okay?","209":"Ouch... Th-thank you. And I'm sorry you had to come help me.","210":"It was my fault in the first place anyway.","211":"I see you are capable of helping more than just beautiful women.","212":"There's a reason why I'm so impartially nice.","213":"When Machérie sees how kind I am, it'll tug right at her heartstrings.","214":"You would risk your very life in the name of another...my, how wonderfully gallant!","215":"Huh? What happened? He was fine a moment ago...","216":"...He's doing it again.","217":"But of course, my sweet. I am the world's kindest gentleman, benevolent to all.","218":"Oh, my dearest Lord Camillo. You are a true gentleman indeed, befitting of the man who will take my hand and heart.","219":"At long last, you have recognized my appeal.","220":"Yes, I sense a heroic radiance from you, one that Mont lacks...","221":"Indeed, my love. This radiance is where you belong, not with the likes of that heinous demon king.","222":"Yes... I wish only to be in your arms, Lord Camillo, not those of that despicable, evil man.","223":"As you wish. These arms are your shield. Nothing shall harm you as long as I live.","224":"Lord Camillo...","225":"My sweet...","226":"...Ah!","227":"What is the matter? Is your little play over already?","228":"I-I'm rehearsing! I don't want to get flustered when Machérie is finally swayed by my devotion.","229":"Lady Machérie will never be swayed by you. Is it not time you realized that?","230":"But she will. Machérie and I will be wed no matter what, just wait and see!","231":"...Hmph. So long as this delusion of yours remains just that, I guess you're free to do as you please.","232":"I can appreciate that kind of thing.","233":"Your determination to never give up is something to be admired!","234":"...I'm very sorry to interrupt, but what are we going to do about the snakes?","235":"Oh, sorry about that, Lucio. Let's get what we need and finish up the job!"},"l_evnt_01_02_1_06c":{"236":"Have we made enough gil, Lord Camillo?","237":"Nope, we're still a little short.","238":"You just accepted another job, right? Won't we have enough after that one?","239":"We will. But I should warn you, the high pay reflects the high risk.","240":"What do we need to do?","241":"We'll be guarding the village's provisions storage from monsters and thieves.","242":"It would appear that after falling on hard times due to the war, these thieves have been raiding the place night after night.","243":"I can't believe anyone would resort to stealing. I'm going to have to beat them back onto the straight and narrow!","244":"As a knight, I cannot let this go unpunished, either.","245":"Hehe. I just knew we would get along well, Elsirelle!","246":"For the time being, let us await nightfall. An ambush would probably be the most effective approach.","247":"I agree. All right, everyone be on the alert near the provisions storage. At the first sight of the enemy, we'll spring into action.","248":"Take it, get as much as you can! Ignore the shiny stuff and just go for the food!","249":"They're here! Okay, I've got an arrow for each and every one of them!","250":"Urgh!","251":"Gah!","252":"Not bad at all. Time for me to cut my way in as well!","253":"Grrrah!","254":"They're so strong! I-I'm getting out of here!","255":"W-wait! Wait for me!","256":"Now, then... Looks like you're the last one left.","257":"P-please, let me go! My sister is ill, you see, and she's waiting for me to come home!","258":"Your sister!? So you were stealing to take care of her?","259":"Y-you believe me?","260":"That's not even the worst of it! If I don't bring this food home to my kids, they'll surely starve!","261":"That's horrible! Grrr, war is so unforgivable...!","262":"Lady Cetia!? Can't you see that he's lying about all of it!?","263":"Who would lie about something like that!? Are you saying you don't believe him!?","264":"Surely there's a more fundamental problem here!","265":"I believe him! Faith in others is the true strength I believe in!","266":"Hahaha, what a pushover! Tricking you was all too easy, you fool!","267":"The only fool here is you. Hyah!","268":"Urgh!","269":"Do NOT listen to a single word your enemy spouts! For thieves like him, lying comes as easily as breathing!","270":"B-but he...","271":"Camillo, we've more or less got it under control here.","272":"Then I think it's about time we wrapped this up!","273":"All right, that was the last of them. There were more than I expected, but nothing too troublesome.","274":"......","275":"Are you all right, Lady Cetia?","276":"It seems that I didn't understand people as well as I thought I did.","277":"I'm sorry I ignored you when you tried to warn me, Lucio.","278":"N-no need to apologize. I wasn't of much help, anyway, seeing how it was Lord Camillo who saved you.","279":"Or you could just thank us by increasing our cut of the profits.","280":"You got it! Take it all!","281":"I-It was a joke! Just some nice words of appreciation will more than suffice.","282":"...Really? Okay, then. Thank you, Camillo.","283":"She should not have to say such things after you coerced her, mind you.","284":"I didn't coerce anybody!","285":"One of the thieves we captured fessed up about a hideout near here.","286":"It wouldn't be right for a knight to not act on this information. We should pay them a visit.","287":"But we've already got all the gil we need...","288":"The raiding of provisions will only continue unless the source of the problem is eliminated.","289":"We should put an end to this now, or else the villagers will continue to struggle.","290":"I'm with you.","291":"More importantly, we can't let these weak-hearted people continue to hurt others with their lies.","292":"We have to get them back on the straight and narrow!","293":"We're going to enter the enemy's base? That sounds risky...","294":"Aren't we obligated to protect the weak and vulnerable?","295":"......! R-right. Yes, that's exactly right!","296":"...Well, the fewer causes of unease waiting for Ovis after its liberation, the better.","297":"I suppose it can't hurt to nip this in the bud. All right, I'm in.","298":"Besides, Machérie could catch wind of this noble act, improving my chances all the more!","299":"Now that we know what we're fighting for, let's go stamp them out.","300":"What's this? No rehearsals this time?","301":"It's not like I do it all the time!","302":"Who the hell are you!?","303":"We're here to beat some moral fiber back into you!","304":"C-calm down, please. We should try talking to him first...","305":"Who do you think you are? Get 'em, lads!","306":"He does not seem to be open to conversation.","307":"That makes this easy then! Mine is the arrow of justice, and with it I'll mend your wicked ways!"},"l_evnt_01_02_1_08c":{"308":"There's no end to them...!","309":"There couldn't possibly be this many lowlifes in one place!","310":"Damn. Quite the backbreaking job this turned out to be.","311":"Thought you could introduce yourself to my behind at a time like this? You wretch.","312":"You've got it all wrong! I'm just trying to watch your back!","313":"Ha, I know. I was merely joking.","314":"It never sounds like a joke when it comes from you...","315":"What should we do? Withdraw and regroup?","316":"Knights do not show their backs to thieves, so I must decline.","317":"Agreed. My sense of justice doesn't allow me to flee before the enemy!","318":"But we're at quite the disadvantage. Shouldn't we take a moment to regroup?","319":"We knew there would be no turning back upon choosing this course of action.","320":"No matter what hardships may arise, there's always a way forward so long as you don't give up.","321":"Warriors of the Crystals don't give up! It's not in the manual!","322":"It's not in the manual...?","323":"I suppose it would be pretty unsightly to retreat now.","324":"I can't give up, not until I'm a man worthy of Machérie!","325":"Lord Camillo...","326":"...Very well. I won't back down, either!","327":"For the sake of the villagers, and for these thieves as well, we're going to win this battle!","328":"You've found your resolve! Stay close and let's do this!","329":"Right!"},"l_evnt_01_02_2_99":{"330":"Not only did you guard the provisions storage, but you even put an end to the thieves' hideout...?","331":"I can't thank you all enough. You've gone above and beyond.","332":"I merely did my duty as a knight.","333":"What a warm reception. I wish I'd been here for the whole thing.","334":"There you are, Lord Camillo! Where were you?","335":"Since we got all the gil we needed, I went and bought our boat.","336":"Which reminds me... Here, as promised.","337":"The Core Crystal! You have my thanks!","338":"No thanks needed. That was the deal, remember?","339":"Now that that's settled, I have a favor to ask. Could you help me move the boat? It's a little too heavy for me by myself.","340":"Of course. Should we ask Cetia and Elsirelle to help as well?","341":"No, let's do it ourselves. May as well show off a little in front of the ladies, you catch my drift?","342":"I...guess so?","343":"I'm sure you do. All right, here we go.","344":"Well, I say we indulge them and lift not a single finger.","345":"Right! Show us what you've got, new recruit!","346":"Heave, ho...! Give it all you've got, Lucio!","347":"Urgh... Even though it's on a cart, this boat is quite heavy.","348":"Was that whining I heard just now, new recruit!? You're a Warrior of the Crystals—try to act like it!","349":"M-my apologies.","350":"...Say, Lucio. Is every Warrior of the Crystals like her?","351":"Hmm...I guess if I had to sum them up, everyone is pretty strict...","352":"I was brought in for this task straight from Lady Jeume's intensive training without a break.","353":"Jeume?","354":"Ah, right. She was the first person to give me guidance.","355":"She speaks very little, which causes her to be misunderstood a lot. And training with her is tougher than dealing with any monster.","356":"Sounds like you've got it rough too, my friend.","357":"But I'm able to learn so much from her and the other warriors.","358":"It all makes me want to try a little harder so that they don't have to scold me as much.","359":"Even though I still lack experience, I have a feeling that I'll become a fine Warrior of the Crystals if I keep learning from them.","360":"...Ooh! It sounds like you've been blessed with some wonderful superiors, huh!","361":"Ow! Wh-what was that for?","362":"Boy, do I envy you!","363":"Listen well, Lucio. If you only take one thing to heart, let it be this—","364":"Your entire life can change overnight just by meeting a good woman.","365":"The day I met Machérie was the day my life changed forever.","366":"Did meeting Elsirelle play a part in that change as well?","367":"I guess you could say that...even though all she does is sleep.","368":"Oh, looks like we're here.","369":"Nice work, new recruit. It was a good training experience, right?","370":"Hahaha...","371":"What's the plan from here for you two?","372":"To return to our realm, of course. We have to get the Crystal back to where it belongs.","373":"Then I guess this is goodbye. You will be missed...","374":"It's not like we're gone for good. We can meet again whenever we fancy!","375":"You're right. May we meet again someday.","376":"Keep working on improving that confidence, Lucio.","377":"Hahaha... I'll try.","378":"Pay me a visit whenever you need a break. I'll take you to try some real delicacies.","379":"Oh, what a splendid idea. Let us make it a feast, your treat.","380":"And why would I be treating you to anything!?","381":"I see...what an unexpectedly heartless travel companion I've been dealt. I must report this to Lady Machérie.","382":"That's shameless extortion and you know it!","383":"Hahaha! You two are so much fun! This is what having close companions is all about!","384":"Alas, Lord Camillo and Lady Elsirelle...it's about time we headed back.","385":"Make sure you perform your duties as a Warrior of the Crystals, no slacking off. Got it?","386":"Make sure to get some sleep when things get rough. It always makes things better.","387":"Understood! Be safe, you two!","388":"See you around!","389":"Well, that's two Crystals now... I'd say things are going about as well as can be expected.","390":"Welcome back. That took an unexpectedly long time.","391":"We happened upon a really amusing pair.","392":"We can discuss what happened later. What's more important now, Lucio, is getting back to your training.","393":"Huh!? But I've only just returned!","394":"That matters not.","395":"B-but...","396":"It sounds like I need to get in on this, too!","397":"I'll train you until you've forgotten how to whine!","398":"That almost sounds like some form of brainwashing...","399":"I'll be preparing in the meantime. Do not be late.","400":"Always doing things at your own pace, huh?","401":"You're the last person I want to hear that from...","402":"W-wait for me! Don't leave me behind!","403":"Did the Crystal just turn dim for a moment?","404":"Hurry up, Lucio.","405":"O-okay, I'll be right there!"},"l_evnt_01_03_0_00":{"001":"Time for our training session. I swear, I'm going to land my first clean hit today!","002":"Ah, Lucio. There you are.","003":"Er, hello... Lord Ranan, isn't it?","004":"That's right. Cetia has been telling me all about you.","005":"She says Jeume has been running you through the wringer.","006":"She has... But it's for my own good, if I'm to become a true Warrior of the Crystals!","007":"A splendid attitude. Now, do you have some time to spare?","008":"My apologies, I have a training session with Lady Jeume...","009":"Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.","010":"B-but I gave her my word...","011":"We have succeeded in pinpointing the location of the third Core Crystal.","012":"You are to accompany me to Ardra. Together, we shall find the Core Crystal and bring it back.","013":"But before we go, there is something I need to explain.","014":"You recall that the flow of time here is different from the rest of the worlds?","015":"Yes. I believe that's why we can go to any place at any time we want...","016":"Precisely. Now on this journey, we will travel to a time somewhat before that of your last outing with Cetia.","017":"So the same Ardra, but further back in the past.","018":"Indeed. So you need to be careful about what you say to the local people.","019":"Revealing too much about future events may have unexpected and unwelcome consequences.","020":"Oh, I don't know anything about history, so I doubt I could tell anyone anything...","021":"Confidence in ignorance, I see.","022":"Still, that shall serve us nicely. Come now, we depart for Ardra immediately.","023":"But I have to attend training with Lady Jeume...","024":"The Will of Light takes precedence over all. If you are a Warrior of the Crystals, you must know that at least!","025":"Well, yes, I suppose you are right... Finding the Core Crystals is our greatest priority, after all.","026":"Good, I am glad you see the way of things. Now, our destination is the kingdom of Wezette.","027":"...If you don't mind me asking... Does Lady Jeume know you're taking me?","028":"Time is of the essence, you see...so naturally, no, she does not.","029":"S-sorry! I really think I should let her know before we depart...","030":"We leave immediately. You can give her a full report with all the lovely details when we return.","031":"That's not the problem here...","032":"Come, apprentice!","033":"W-waaait! If I don't go to training, Lady Jeume is going to—","034":"Where is that Lucio!? We are supposed to be training today.","035":"Oh, if you're looking for Lucio, Ranan took him. Apparently, the third Core Crystal has been located.","036":"Ranan, you say? The poor boy... He has no idea what he's gotten himself into.","037":"Hahaha! We may have our moments, but we're not a patch on that tyrant!","038":"At last, at last, the day has come! The day that I win the favor of King Khury!","039":"How long have I labored for this opportunity!","040":"How I whipped the serfs to greater effort, how I wringed wealth from the land like blood from a stone!","041":"But now the reward is within my grasp!","042":"I have learned from the success of my peers and prepared a hearty donation for His Highness.","043":"The king will clap his hands in delight when I then share details of the ores that can be mined from my lands.","044":"Then I shall bathe in the light of his favor! HAHAHAHA!","045":"Monologuing so the people can hear him. Does the fool not know that he injures his own repute?","046":"I doubt that any noble of this realm cares what the people think.","047":"No matter how poorly they treat the people, with the king and the army behind them, the aristocrats needn't fear rebellion.","048":"The poor people have nowhere else to go, no place to escape to.","049":"In the west is our enemy, Hourne. Too dangerous to flee there. Leonis is an ally, but unstable and on the brink of war with Fennes.","050":"Wezette is the safest place, for now. Tyrannical and poverty-stricken as it is.","051":"But it cannot go on like this. We...we need to make things better, Cadia!","052":"Yes... And we will!"},"l_evnt_01_03_1_02c":{"053":"Yikes... I wasn't expecting to be assailed by monsters the moment we arrived.","054":"The reports appear to be accurate. The Core Crystal's magic causes monsters to grow more belligerent.","055":"Clearly, we are on the right path. The Core Crystal is somewhere in this land.","056":"Do you see that fortress over yonder? That is Wezette Castle.","057":"It's incredible...","058":"However, we are not here to indulge the sights.","059":"Our mission is to recover the Core Crystal.","060":"Yes, sir!","061":"Unfortunately, it is not here. I sense vague traces, but not the Crystal itself.","062":"Do you think someone beat us to it?","063":"That is possible. Or it could be in the belly of some monster, for all we know.","064":"In the belly of a monster? That brings back memories I'd rather forget.","065":"Whatever the circumstances, our mission remains unchanged. No matter who, or what monsters may get in our way.","066":"Huh?","067":"These ones look rather hungry, too. Behold the bared fangs and slavering maws.","068":"Do you think they're under the Core Crystal's spell, too?","069":"Most likely, yes.","070":"But bewitched by the Crystal or not, they are not afforded its protection.","071":"As a Warrior of the Crystals, I cannot let these beasts run amok.","072":"Come! Let us deal with them—swiftly and decisively.","073":"...Hmph. Their bark was worse than their bite.","074":"For frenzied monsters, they seemed slow on their feet.","075":"Well noted, apprentice. Apparently Jeume and Cetia managed to teach you some things on your journeys.","076":"Not only were these beasts half-starved, they were half-frozen, too.","077":"Even under the influence of the Core Crystal, they gained no strength worthy of deeming a threat.","078":"They were in too weakened a state to begin with.","079":"I see...","080":"Nevertheless, they attack the moment they find prey. Their resolve is commendable, in the very least.","081":"That said, a large enough mob could be dangerous. Quantity has a quality all of its own.","082":"For now, let us make haste to Wezette and learn what we can.","083":"I hope we find some good clues.","084":"Indeed... Let us pray we can conclude this smoothly.","085":"I've asked around, but no one seems to know anything helpful about the Core Crystal.","086":"Sir? Is it just me, or is something off about these people? They all seem so―I don't know―lifeless.","087":"Yes. I noted that also, and dug around a little into the circumstances of this nation.","088":"Apparently, trouble is brewing between Wezette and its powerful neighbor to the west, Hourne.","089":"The situation is tense, and the people here are being driven into poverty and starvation, with no hope of fleeing elsewhere.","090":"Poverty, huh...","091":"I feel like there are some people who are quite well fed.","092":"Those would be nobles. They curry favor with the king and live in luxury thanks to his protection.","093":"That doesn't sound fair. How can a king favor the few and leave most of his subjects to starve!","094":"A country this big should have more than enough to go around.","095":"Perhaps, perhaps not. Either way, it is no concern of ours, and certainly not our place to meddle.","096":"Don't you care at all?","097":"I care about our mission, apprentice. We are here to recover the Core Crystal. Or have you forgotten that?","098":"If the people here do not have the will to help themselves, then what succor could we offer?","099":"It is their duty to remedy their circumstances, yet these people stand about waiting with their collective mouths agape...","100":"What a miserable lot. This is the price they pay for no longer engaging their minds, yet I doubt they even know it.","101":"I'm sorry to say, Lucio, but I cannot summon sympathy, nor even pity, for those who do not help themselves.","102":"To change your life, you must think, then act boldly.","103":"Time spent thinking about those who fail to even begin this process is time wasted.","104":"I-I suppose you might have a point, but...","105":"You would do better not to judge these people so harshly.","106":"Um, who might you be?","107":"My name is Glaciela. The successor to the throne of this realm, for the time being at least.","108":"And I'm Cadia, Lady Glaciela's sister and personal guard.","109":"The heir to the throne? An honor, indeed.","110":"But pray tell. Do members of the royal family often wander outside the castle accosting strangers?","111":"...I come into the town to learn about the realm. To see how our people live, through their eyes.","112":"I could not help but overhear your conversation. It piqued my interest.","113":"We're not planning to start a rebellion, if that's what you think.","114":"No... But I agree with you, young man, and not your gentleman friend. This poverty must end.","115":"No one cares more for the plight of these people than my sister.","116":"It is no secret that Wezette is a land gripped by despair, bereft of hope.","117":"And yet here you are, discussing the plight of our people. It would be strange not to be gripped by curiosity.","118":"Our mistake was to speak too loudly. Lucio, in the future, when you have something to say, say it quietly.","119":"But you were the one who was getting all worked up...","120":"Hehe, you are an interesting pair―and certainly not from these parts. Have you journeyed far?","121":"Er, well, yes...and no. It's a little complicated.","122":"It is enough to state that we are travelers, in search of a Core Crystal.","123":"A crystal unlike any other, both in form and color. Most distinctive. You haven't, perchance, heard of such an artifact?","124":"A Core Crystal...? My apologies, I am not sure I can help you.","125":"But allow me to clarify; it is definitely a form of crystal, yes?","126":"Are you thinking what I'm thinking...?","127":"Yes, I believe Minwu may know something.","128":"Who's Minwu?","129":"A friend who knows a great deal about crystals and magic and the like. She is waiting for us back at our base.","130":"Maybe it was fate, us meeting here. Shall we introduce you?","131":"What do you say, Lord Ranan?","132":"I say yes, of course, without the slightest of doubt whatsoever.","133":"Then it is settled. Come on, we'll show you to the headquarters of «Spirare», my private brigade.","134":"We're back. Is Minwu around?","135":"Lady Glaciela, you called?","136":"I wanted to introduce you to some people. They are searching for a rare item known as a Core Crystal.","137":"Hello. My name is Lucio.","138":"Ranan, at your service.","139":"Pleased to meet you. I am Minwu, aide to Lady Glaciela.","140":"We were wondering if you might have heard talk of a rare and unusual crystal.","141":"An unusual crystal? Well...it's funny that you mention it...","142":"What? You know something?","143":"Yes. A story I just heard, from a friend in Wezette Castle...","144":"Apparently, a new and unusual crystal was recently discovered.","145":"I don't know if it's the one you seek, but it may be worth a look.","146":"Our most promising lead thus far. I dared not hope that we would find the trail so quickly.","147":"If this crystal is the one you are looking for, is it something we should be worried about?","148":"No. Not when it is used for its original purpose.","149":"Though it could be dangerous were it to fall into the hands of self-serving fools.","150":"I have heard that this realm is teetering on the brink of war with mighty Hourne.","151":"In such circumstances, military leaders could be tempted to risk everything for the promise of victory.","152":"There is enough magical power within the Core Crystal to tip the balance in a war.","153":"Oh, and we recently found out that monsters become extra ferocious when they are exposed to it.","154":"Which means its continued presence in these lands is actually pretty dangerous in itself.","155":"In that case...we might have a problem.","156":"What do you mean?","157":"Apparently, the authorities have decided to study it in more detail.","158":"It's to be taken to the magic research institute.","159":"...Tsk. Of course it is.","160":"If what you say is true, this Core Crystal could provide the Wezette army with untold power.","161":"But it could be used for peaceful ends, too. Imagine being able to give the people new hope...","162":"That's what we dream of, isn't it? ...But I doubt that would be allowed to happen.","163":"The nobles would have too much to lose. The common folk are made to suffer, to exist only as long as they can be exploited.","164":"......","165":"What's on your mind, Lucio?","166":"...Could we speak privately, sir?","167":"I'm sorry, sir, but I didn't want to say this in front of the others.","168":"I see.","169":"If these people had the Core Crystal, they could use it to improve the lives of everyone in this country.","170":"But that will never happen if we take it away from here.","171":"It's almost as if we'd be stealing the one chance they have to mend this country.","172":"It makes me wonder if we're actually doing the right thing.","173":"So to help the people of this foreign land, you would cast aside your sworn duties? Does your oath mean so little?","174":"That's not what I meant...","175":"Let me give you a word of counsel. A Warrior of the Crystals must never waver. To do so is to willingly dull both mind and blade alike.","176":"Doubt is born of insufficient resolve. Allowed to fester, it will strip you of your courage.","177":"My resolve...","178":"If you ever find yourself straying from the path, remember your mission! Focus on what must be done!","179":"Suffer if you must, but never abandon your resolve. Always engage your mind, for in there you shall find hope.","180":"Lord Ranan...","181":"In any case, it is up to this realm to solve its own problems.","182":"We are interlopers here, and it is not our place to meddle.","183":"Mind your own affairs, afore you worry about those of others.","184":"Y-you're right, of course. I'm sorry. I mustn't be so quick to forget my duty!","185":"Bring back the Core Crystals and restore the balance of the universe. That's my mission!","186":"Exactly, Lucio. You learn quickly.","187":"What are you two whispering about?","188":"My apologies. A private matter, of no import.","189":"Now, Lady Minwu. Tell me where we might find this magic research institute.","190":"It lies beyond the snow plains. Not close, by any means, but it can be reached by foot.","191":"We are grateful for the information. If we move quickly, perhaps we can intercept the crystal before it reaches its destination.","192":"Yes! Thank you so much! We'll really appreciate― Er, Lord Ranan? Sir, wait for me!","193":"...And there they go.","194":"Who were they, anyway?","195":"I know not. They seemed well-intentioned, though.","196":"Well, then. It is time for me to leave, too.","197":"Sister...?","198":"It's all right, Cadia. Khury wants to see me, that's all.","199":"Please be careful. That man is a cold-hearted brute.","200":"...Trust me, I know all too well what he is."},"l_evnt_01_03_1_04c":{"201":"Is it just me, or have these monsters been getting more ferocious the farther we travel?","202":"They have. Evidence, I'd say, that we are getting closer to the Core Crystal.","203":"The Crystal's resonance is not far off. It should not take us long to reach it.","204":"But not so if we have to keep fighting monsters the whole way.","205":"Agreed. Perhaps we should try donning the monsters' furs?","206":"Furs? You mean, to keep us warm?","207":"I mean to avoid needless battles. We cloak ourselves in the monsters' fur and thereby hide our scent.","208":"If we can fool them into thinking we are one of their own, we may pass unmolested.","209":"Ah, I see! That's a brilliant idea, sir!","210":"Indeed it is. Now, go relieve those monsters of their furs.","211":"Yes, sir! I'll skin these ones. Would you handle those over there?","212":"...Sadly, I do not carry a suitable blade. You'll need to work double-time.","213":"Hey, no fair...","214":"These hides keep the chill out, but the stink of blood is making my head spin... Gurg!","215":"Yes. They are surely masking our scent―but I am starting to think this plan could have been better formulated.","216":"Erm, Lord Ranan? So, Wezette and Hourne are at war, is that right?","217":"On the brink of war, if we are to be precise.","218":"But why even think about having a war? It would be far better for both sides if they could just get along.","219":"It is because people lack resolve.","220":"I'm not sure what you mean...","221":"Indecisiveness leads to suspicion, which breeds discord. Discord creates enemies, and enemies inevitably go to war.","222":"To survive in this world, people will bring down others without a second thought. This is what creates the divide among them.","223":"You saw the nobles back in the town. They care nothing for the common folk.","224":"Humans are crueler than you know, apprentice. The man who would sacrifice himself for another is rare indeed.","225":"...I think you're wrong.","226":"Oh?","227":"Nearly every person I've ever met has been kind, and always willing to lend a helping hand.","228":"Lady Vinera and Lord Tyrrell, and Lord Dario, they all taught me the value of caring for others...","229":"Lord Camillo and Lady Elsirelle stuck to their beliefs, and followed what they believed was the right path...","230":"And don't forget Lady Glaciela and her friends. They chose not to wait, but to take action and make this nation a better place for everyone.","231":"I learned in my previous missions that people aren't all cruel and ugly―they can be good, too!","232":"And peace isn't just a dream. People can work together to build a world without war.","233":"You are young and naive.","234":"......","235":"But you have resolve. You believe in what you say.","236":"Perhaps I've underestimated you. Your journeys seem to have been a bigger boon to you than I'd thought.","237":"Lord Ranan...","238":"Hold onto that belief, young apprentice. Never let doubt cloud your heart.","239":"Keep a strong heart, full of resolve, for someday it will be the pillar upon which you depend.","240":"...Yes, sir!","241":"The blizzard grows ever worse. I can hardly see the nose in front of my face. What should we do, Lord Ranan?","242":"......","243":"Lord Ranan?","244":"What a wretched fool I am.","245":"Is something wrong, sir?","246":"Lucio. I'm afraid there is.","247":"We have strayed from the path. We are lost in the wild.","248":"...Whaaat!?"},"l_evnt_01_03_1_06c":{"249":"Glaciela Wezette, at your request.","250":"You are late, Glaciela. There are not many who would dare keep me waiting.","251":"I was in town, to take measure of conditions there... What is the purpose of this summons?","252":"It is high time I explained to you the conditions by which you may inherit the throne.","253":"Conditions?","254":"Think about your background, and what would happen if it were more widely known. Your status as heir is by no means assured.","255":"I think it best, then, that we nip the buds of regret afore they bloom. Think of it as...a test.","256":"...Then what are these conditions of yours?","257":"To be precise, there is only one.","258":"You are to extinguish your mother's clan. Every last member.","259":"...Excuse me?","260":"Am I being unclear? You are to kill every last one who shares your mother's blood.","261":"Y-you...cannot mean this. To claim the throne I must kill my kin? Is this some sort of ill-conceived jest?","262":"Hmph. Come on now, girl. Does it sound like I jest?","263":"...! Then if you are serious, what is the reason for such a demand!?","264":"Your mother was not even remotely of noble blood. Your vassals and subjects would never bend the knee to one with the taint of a commoner.","265":"I, too, would endure much censure, were it known that I helped place a half-breed upon the royal throne.","266":"Therefore, before your origins are discovered, you must wipe out every trace of them.","267":"For that...my mother...her family... All must die?","268":"Come now, Glaciela. You know the ways of this world. Do you truly think that a queen of non-noble blood could rule?","269":"If you are to claim your rightful future and serve this realm, you must strike off the shackles of your past!","270":"...I refuse! I cannot possibly agree to such conditions!","271":"Your approval is not relevant. I am telling you what must be done. This is an order, Glaciela.","272":"...You are inhuman.","273":"No one who besmirches me will be forgiven. No one.","274":"...If a dog spurns you, or a chocobo throws you, must it be killed? If it is your own family, must they all die?","275":"Every last one. And if you do not do as I bid, civil war will rip this realm apart.","276":"The only way to avoid that is to ensure no one ever learns of your origins.","277":"Is change not an option for Wezette's future?","278":"The traditions of this realm have made it strong. They are the reason we are unbroken by other nations⁠—and this must not change.","279":"A kingdom cannot be protected without sacrifices, and every great sovereign must at times make ruthless choices.","280":"You are too young yet to understand any of this.","281":"...Hmph! It would seem my ideals for sovereignty are clearly different to yours.","282":"...Good day!","283":"Foolish girl. But she will learn...","284":"A report!","285":"What is it?","286":"Lady Glaciela has marched out of Wezette at the head of «Spirare»!","287":"...Let her go.","288":"B-but sir, she might...","289":"I care not. The matter is in hand.","290":"Glaciela... Your path is one without hope.","291":"...It was a stroke of luck, us finding this cave when we did. But...","292":"I didn't think there'd be quite so many monsters crawling around in here!","293":"They are no foes of ours. Get them.","294":"It's never ending!","295":"...It makes little sense.","296":"Huh?","297":"Think about it.","298":"The Core Crystals maintain the balance of the universe.","299":"In other words, they exist so that all things may settle into a state of stability.","300":"Given that, it seems strange that a Core Crystal should cause such instability as making monsters run amok.","301":"Isn't it just that the Core Crystal's enormous magic makes their minds go awry?","302":"...That is the theory, certainly. But is that truly the reason? After all, no one has ever proven it.","303":"...Now that you mention it, I hadn't really put it to deep thought.","304":"I mean, what if the Core Crystals that the Will of Light protects are actually harmful to the world?","305":"The Crystals may harbor secrets that we don't know, and aren't meant to know.","306":"Or perhaps they are no longer the Crystals that we believe them to be...","307":"Either way, this one is too dangerous to be left in the hands of humanity.","308":"It could help win a war, yes―but its very existence could ensure more war in the future, over and over again.","309":"In that case, we really do have to get out of here.","310":"Indeed. Cover my back, apprentice! Let us fight our way out together!","311":"Yes, sir!"},"l_evnt_01_03_1_08c":{"312":"The blizzard has finally abated.","313":"...Sister! There are people ahead!","314":"Aren't they the two we met in town?","315":"Lucio and Ranan. I thought they were looking for that crystal.","316":"We can't leave them here.","317":"Well, well. The heir to the Wezette throne herself. I hardly expected to meet you out here, Your Highness.","318":"I'm not queen yet. Glaciela is fine.","319":"Please ignore him... Anyway, what are you doing out here?","320":"I could ask you the same thing. Last we met, you were bound for the magic research institute.","321":"Yes, we were. But then this blizzard blew in...","322":"It is hardly wise to wander across a strange land in the middle of a snowstorm.","323":"I wonder if we could prevail on you to show us the way.","324":"As you know, our mission is somewhat urgent. We cannot afford to get lost again.","325":"Tell me again what you intend to do with this Core Crystal, assuming you manage to locate it.","326":"I suppose if you are to help us, you deserve to know the truth.","327":"...And that is the sum of it.","328":"So, as a Warrior of the Crystals, you are here on a quest to restore the balance of the world...","329":"Which means, your intention is to take this Core Crystal away from Wezette.","330":"Yes. We must bring it back home, if we are to fulfill our mission.","331":"I'm sorry. I know this makes us seem like enemies of Wezette...","332":"I think not. I doubt very much if these ladies would want this Core Crystal in their kingdom.","333":"...Why do you say that?","334":"I realized it back at the town, the moment you gave us the information about the Crystal's whereabouts.","335":"And now you stand before me, Lady Glaciela, and I see the fury burning in your eyes.","336":"......!","337":"It's about them, isn't it? The ones who rule Wezette. You do not want them to have the power of the Core Crystal.","338":"You wanted to be sure that our intention was to take the Core Crystal far away from Wezette, for it conforms precisely with your own wishes.","339":"However, that task might prove difficult for just Lucio and I.","340":"We could fail, and then the power would fall into the hands of the Wezette army, potentially creating an irreversible course of events.","341":"...Of course, I speak merely of possibilities.","342":"......","343":"Sister...?","344":"If the Core Crystal does reach the magic research institute, it may well turn out as he says.","345":"...Tell me more.","346":"I've worked at the institute myself. I know the risks they are willing to take.","347":"If they were able to access the Crystal's power...","348":"...And if the army could use it, Wezette would gain the ultimate secret weapon.","349":"We have to intercept it before it reaches the institute, or it may be too late.","350":"...It would seem there is but one choice to be made. But you two knew that from the beginning, didn't you?","351":"Begging your pardon, Lady Glaciela...but what fills you with so much anger?","352":"The truth is... We are in the midst of forming a rebel army. We aim to overthrow Khury.","353":"Khury? The king of Wezette?!","354":"As long as the tyrant sits on the throne, this country has no future.","355":"B-but why...?","356":"That is enough, Lucio. These matters are not our concern, and we'd best stay out of them.","357":"In any case, the short of it is that we do not want the Wezette army to grow any stronger.","358":"«Spirare» is ready to help you. Do you accept our offer?","359":"What do you say, Lord Ranan?","360":"Of course we accept. That was our wish from the very outset, after all.","361":"While your lack of resolution has cost us precious time, I respect your motivations.","362":"We shall make use of the full extent of your services, so that we may yet safely bring the Core Crystal back home.","363":"By all means, please do.","364":"Caravan escorts. This must be it.","365":"The Core Crystal must be in that carriage.","366":"They are almost at the magic research institute. We need to act quickly...","367":"Perhaps we should wait for a better opportunity? Their defenses are well prepared.","368":"...I think we should attack right away.","369":"Hm.","370":"We have to get the Core Crystal before they reach the magic research institute, don't we?","371":"I can't just sit here and do nothing!","372":"Besides, there might even be more Wezette soldiers at the institute.","373":"I think we should strike before their forces become even stronger.","374":"...A suggestion truly devoid of forethought.","375":"......","376":"But situationally, the prospects of a favorable conclusion are not entirely absent.","377":"Huh?","378":"You are right, Lucio. Sometimes it is indeed best to act first and think later.","379":"Now, steel yourself. This shall not be an easy battle.","380":"Yes, sir! Thank you, Lord Ranan!","381":"Then it's settled. We strike now. Get ready, everyone.","382":"It is time to recover that Core Crystal.","383":"Let's give the Wezette army a taste of «Spirare» steel!","384":"All units, charge!"},"l_evnt_01_03_2_99":{"385":"It's over!","386":"Arrrrgh!","387":"Lord Ranan! The Core Crystal!","388":"Fear not. As you can see, we have it secured.","389":"Phew... So the plan worked.","390":"By \"plan,\" you mean the reckless charge? But, yes. The element of surprise enabled us to break through their lines.","391":"Lady Glaciela. Thank you for your assistance.","392":"No need to thank us. We would have ended up fighting this battle someday even without the Core Crystal in our lands.","393":"Were you never tempted to use the Core Crystal yourself, to help Wezette?","394":"It might have served you well in your fight against Khury.","395":"...No. If we are to change Wezette, it must be by our own efforts.","396":"And I'm not so naive to think that possessing something so powerful would not have consequences.","397":"Even if the Core Crystal did give us victory, we would soon attract enemies seeking the Crystal for themselves.","398":"This land will never know peace, so long as that Core Crystal remains here.","399":"Hm. If a person such as you is to become queen, then perhaps the dream of peace is more than just a dream.","400":"It's a dream I intend to keep alive.","401":"Call it my mission―though it's hardly as grand as keeping the entire world in balance.","402":"Lady Glaciela. We promise to keep your world safe.","403":"But in return, promise that you will build a brighter future for your people.","404":"It would make it all worthwhile, being able to see that.","405":"I can promise that. We are going to change our country, and the world, for the better.","406":"But for now, we need to lie low until we have amassed the strength we need to fight back... Which means this is where we part ways.","407":"Truth be told, we could use a pair of warriors like yourselves in our rebellion.","408":"I'm sorry we can't offer more aid, but we have to complete our own mission first.","409":"I know. Destiny has set us upon different paths―let us pray we both succeed!","410":"We will!","411":"If you are finished, Lucio, come here, and speedily.","412":"We need to leave this place before Wezette realizes something is amiss and sends more troops.","413":"Lady Glaciela, soldiers of «Spirare». From one world to another, I pray that you triumph in the struggle to come.","414":"Thank you for all your help!","415":"I shall keep my promise. We'll bring prosperity and peace to this realm!","416":"Well done, Lucio. The mission was not easy, but you have exceeded my expectations.","417":"Th-thank you, sir.","418":"You even taught me a lesson―that sometimes it is best to act without thinking too much.","419":"We all have much to learn, and it appears that you have things to teach me.","420":"D-don't say that, sir. You're making me uncomfortable.","421":"...It is about time you showed your face.","422":"Yikes! L-lady Jeume...","423":"Welcome back! It seems that the pair of you have had quite an adventure.","424":"Was it worth abandoning scheduled training with a superior? The lack of respect beggars belief!","425":"W-wait! I wanted to tell you before I left, I truly did! But Lord Ranan...","426":"Simmer down, Jeume. I am sure he is very sorry for the insult.","427":"Lord Ranan, are you...standing up for me?","428":"Now about his training. I have observed a weak point that needs attention.","429":"He has a habit of leaving his left side unguarded. If you were to focus on addressing this, I am sure he will be most grateful.","430":"Understood.","431":"L-Lord Ranan!? I thought you were on my side!","432":"You wish to become a true Warrior of the Crystals, yes? Then you must grow stronger.","433":"Are you done? Our training awaits.","434":"B-but...","435":"......!?","436":"Huh...?","437":"Th-that light!","438":"Wh-what the...?","439":"Well, well...","440":"Ranan. Do you know something about this?","441":"I have a supposition, and no more. But if true...","442":"Lord Ranan? What is this...?","443":"I do not indulge in idle speculation about the unknown. I shall keep my thoughts to myself for now.","444":"But sir...","445":"Oh, don't worry. You learned a lot on this last adventure of yours, right?","446":"For a young apprentice like you, experience is everything. I'm sure this is just the culmination of it all!","447":"So...the body glows when it grows stronger?","448":"I have no idea!","449":"But you just made it sound like it's a thing!","450":"If you are done glowing, then get a move on. You have double the work now, to make up for what you skipped.","451":"But that wasn't my fault! Lady Jeume, wait!","452":"Hmm...a new Warrior of the Crystals..."},"l_evnt_01_04_0_00":{"001":"......","002":"What was happening to me? And what was that strange light that came pouring out of me?","003":"Ranan seemed to know something―but he made it clear he didn't want to speculate.","004":"Was it a sign that I'm on the path to becoming a Warrior of the Crystals? Hmm...","005":"I can't just ignore what happened... So what do I do?","006":"Greetings, apprentice. You're talking to yourself, you know.","007":"Oh, Lord Velis! ...Actually, something's troubling me and maybe you can―","008":"Ah, stop, stop! Not another word.","009":"But...","010":"If you're looking for worldly advice, go talk to Cetia or Ranan.","011":"I'm not one for getting involved in anything remotely bothersome. The woes of my junior compatriots are none of my business.","012":"So save your breath, all right? I hear nothing, I see nothing. Clear?","013":"Crystal clear... I guess I'll talk to one of the others when I have the chance.","014":"That's more like it. A better use of both our time, I assure you.","015":"And speaking of which, I have a matter to discuss with you.","016":"Let me guess. Is it about recovering another Core Crystal?","017":"Excellent, you catch on fast. Suppose that's why they call you the promising one.","018":"I-I don't think I'm all that promising, to be honest...","019":"You'd best enjoy praise when it comes your way. You'll hear precious little of it when you get older, trust me.","020":"But we're getting off track. For this task, you'll be going back in time again, even further in the past than your adventure with Ranan.","021":"You remember the rules, right? No interfering, no careless chatter about events yet to happen.","022":"Find the Core Crystal and bring it back. Nothing more. Got it?","023":"I won't let you down, sir! I swear we will bring the Core Crystal back!","024":"That's the spirit. The other three weren't wrong about you.","025":"Well then! I leave the rest in your capable hands! Show me what you can do, new recruit!","026":"Huh!? W-wait a minute! What about you?","027":"What about me? I've explained your task, which means my work here is done.","028":"Do you mean to say, I'm to go on my own?","029":"Well, I'm supposed to be joining you, but these find-and-retrieve missions are just so mind-numbing.","030":"That's an astonishing admission for a Warrior of the Crystals...","031":"You've already found three Core Crystals. You're practically an expert now. Trust me―you'll be fine.","032":"I'll be with you in spirit. Walk tall and have at it!","033":"This really doesn't feel right...","034":"Look, I'm the most senior Warrior, and that makes me sort of a leader around here. Catch my drift?","035":"You really don't want to lift a finger, do you sir...","036":"What are you two dilly-dallying here for? You should be long gone by now.","037":"Gah! Ranan...","038":"Don't \"gah\" me, Velis. You had better not be trying to foist this mission onto our young recruit.","039":"Th-the thought never crossed my mind! I was only jesting! Right, Lucio?","040":"Sure...","041":"*sigh* You never change, do you Velis? Now get a move on―you're wasting valuable time.","042":"Fine, fine.","043":"Oh, and Lucio? I want you to be particularly heedful on this quest.","044":"Why is that, sir?","045":"I'm concerned we may be taking too long to restore the Core Crystals.","046":"Call it a bad feeling, if you will. In any case, stay on your toes.","047":"That's a bit vague...","048":"Come on, new recruit. Let's get moving before a certain someone lectures the life out of us.","049":"N-n-no, wait! I still have something to ask Lord Ranan―","050":"And here we are. In the domain of Leonis, to be precise.","051":"Now I won't be able to talk to Lord Ranan until we get back...","052":"Haha, sorry about that. But I had the feeling we'd end up being subjected to something both long-winded and mind-numbing.","053":"...You know, I'm starting to think that I'm not in the safest pair of hands.","054":"I'd be insulted, except I can definitely see where you're coming from.","055":"But chin up, eh? You have the most senior Warrior at your side.","056":"I...almost feel convinced this might go well.","057":"Trust me, there's no need to dwell on what is now past... Hm, what's this?","058":"What's what?","059":"I just sensed the Core Crystal. But there's something... Mmm. No, that doesn't bode well.","060":"It doesn't?","061":"I sense the Core Crystal is close, but something approaches it at terrific speed.","062":"Th-then we have to hurry, right?","063":"Definitely. Alas, it's going to require far too much effort to beat it to the mark, so it's probably best we give up now.","064":"We can't do that!","065":"I jest, I jest. It's not worth risking Ranan's wrath over something like this.","066":"Let's hurry to the Core Crystal, and pray that it isn't lost by the time we get to it.","067":"*pant pant* ...Wh-where is it?","068":"Over there. Just lying in the dirt.","069":"Then we'd better retrieve it!","070":"I'd like nothing more, but it looks like we're too late.","071":"Huh...?","072":"A monster! And it's enormous!","073":"Wait, no don't...! Argh!","074":"What do we do now? The monster's swallowed the Core Crystal whole!","075":"Gah... This is the worst thing that could've happened. We'll have to make it cough up the Crystal.","076":"This should make for a good warm-up. Hope you're ready to taste steel, you gluttonous gulper!","077":"This should do it...!","078":"I-I had no idea you were so strong!","079":"Stop gawking like you've never seen someone bring a behemoth to its knees and finish it off!","080":"Yes, sir!","081":"Wh-what's happening!?","082":"It called more monsters!","083":"More than just that. The behemoth compelled them with that roar to protect it, like the leader of a pack would.","084":"There's too many of them. We can't get close!","085":"It ran away... We have to go after it!","086":"Hold it. There's such a thing as trying too hard, and we put ourselves at far too much risk against those numbers.","087":"First things first. Are you all right? Ranan would have me for lunch AND dinner if you got hurt.","088":"I'm fine. Just a few scratches.

Could this be what he meant?","094":"That was just meant to be a joke...

Perhaps we just happened to run into the only intelligent behemoth in Leonis.","096":"Either way, we need to follow the monster.

You're a prince, is that right?","196":"Yes, though sometimes I don't feel like one with Father constantly rebuking me for being foolish and weak.","197":"But even so, that means you'll be a king one day, doesn't it?","198":"I wonder... My younger brother is a better fit for the throne, I'd say.","199":"But whether or not I become king, my dream is to build bridges with other lands, and make Leonis a nation that is a friend to all.","200":"A nation that stands side by side with the other great houses, not across from them on a battlefield.","201":"A country that never does harm... I think that's a wonderful dream.","202":"...You do? Most people scoff to hear it, and tell me I'm naive―if they're not too busy laughing, that is.","203":"Building a world without war, where everyone lives in peace... I can't think of anything better.","204":"It is truly heartening to hear that, even if few others share your opinion.","205":"...On my last journey, I went to a country gripped by tyranny, and saw what that meant with my own eyes.","206":"The people there had no hope, their spirits were crushed, and because of war, they had nowhere to flee.","207":"But it doesn't have to be like that, especially if someone like you wears the crown.","208":"I want to see nations like the one you dream of building.","209":"...Then I shall do all in my power to make it so.","210":"You shouldn't doubt yourself, you know. About being a king, I mean.","211":"I've learned that the strongest people are those who care about the happiness of others.","212":"...I appreciate that. It was a kind twist of fate, us meeting here.","213":"I-I'm sorry to speak frankly.

A sign of your awakening as a Warrior of the Crystals.","344":"My awakening...?","345":"In other words, today's your graduation day. Congratulations.","346":"Gosh, really? I, er... Wait...my legs have gone all wobbly...","347":"Hardly surprising. It was a long, arduous battle, and then you top it off with your newly awakened power.","348":"You'll need training to learn how to control that power and use it when you need it.","349":"Haha...more training.","350":"Anyway, that's enough lessons for one day, I'd say.","351":"We have the Core Crystal, and it's time we took it home.","352":"Home? ...Right, you do not hail from this world.","353":"Which means this is farewell.","354":"Lucio. I hope we shall meet again.","355":"We will.

Who were those people?","361":"Friends like none other, from a world we'll never see.","362":"...Everything is in place.","363":"Now at last, it can begin.","364":"I shall release them, the ones ensnared in the chains of fate...","365":"And thus shall I fulfill the promise I made.","366":"Freedom lies within my grasp.","367":"Congratulations are in order. You've had your awakening.","368":"I knew you'd do it! Didn't I say from the beginning that Lucio had it in him?","369":"He's awakened? Well then, let's see it.","370":"I can't just do it. It sort of happened by accident. I don't know how, to be honest.","371":"Oh...how disappointing.","372":"But it's still a big step! You just have to learn how to control it now.","373":"Once you can do that, you'll be ever so powerful!","374":"...So, we just need to mercilessly drill him until he can use this power upon command.","375":"Exactly! He just needs training, that's all.","376":"Hahaha! Look at you, Lucio. The man of the hour.","377":"I'm starting to feel like I've opened the gates to something I am not going to like...","378":"I imagine you have much to report, but for now, let me just say well done.","379":"Velis, it's a rare turn of events for you to see a mission through to the very end.

But there's one more thing before you do...","382":"Right, I have to return the Core Crystal where it belongs.","383":"All right, here goes.

You could even say it is the very history of Wezette.","014":"......","015":"Perhaps I should tell you of the world beyond your cell. Muraga is no more, and Fennes stands divided.","016":"Divided? Have they taken new sides?","017":"Oldoa has hailed to Leonis...but that matters not.","018":"The bigger issue is likely the fact Wezette has opened its gates to Melnia and Ranell.","019":"Melnia and Ranell...?

Quite the vexing pair, I assure you.","021":"Life in Saiga did not work out for Melnia, so she followed her desires beyond the village.","022":"Surely there would be naught for the alliance of Hourne and Leonis to fear...","023":"Outsiders such as yourself know nothing of what Khury has up his sleeve.","024":"...A last resort, I assume?","025":"Indeed. Whatever it is, he rushes to have it prepared.","026":"I was expecting him to save it for Rundall, mind you...","027":"But the prideful Khury has deemed the united armies of Hourne and Leonis to be a threat...","028":"Which can only mean that the young lion you put your life on the line to help escape is made of the right mettle.","029":"Alas, for me time is now of the essence...","030":"Do you mean to say...you will aid us?","031":"Sadly I don't think I will be taking sides in this affair.","032":"Then your goal is Khury and nothing else?","033":"Even if Hourne and Leonis must be a pawn to that end...","034":"Exactly.","035":"What is it that drives you so?","036":"Khury...murdered my father.","037":"......","038":"He was once a strategist under Khury.","039":"At the time, Khury had sired children to women other than his queen, and the resulting conflict over royal succession left Wezette in a state of chaos.","040":"Fearing for the future of the nation, my father offered his advice.","041":"He suggested announcing to the people that Glaciela, the most skilled of his children in warfare, was to be his successor.","042":"Not only did Khury have no mind to listen, he raged at the notion of having his methods questioned and executed my father for what he deemed treason.","043":"Unfathomable...","044":"That is life under Khury.","045":"And what became of the royal succession?","046":"Khury pit his heirs against each other. He declared that it would be the survivor who succeeds him.","047":"And that survivor was Glaciela...","048":"Correct. The very same Glaciela my father advised in favor of...","049":"To what end was my father killed...?","050":"......","051":"Overcome with grief I suppose, my mother voiced her discontent to Khury.","052":"I tried to stop her, alas...","053":"Your mother met the same end...","054":"Not only her, but my older sister as well...","055":"But you were spared that fate...","056":"You do not possibly think that Khury's wretched heart knows mercy, do you?","057":"Do you know the reason I lived...?","058":"No...","059":"I licked his boots. No—I performed even more unsavory acts than that.","060":"Not only for myself, but for my younger sister as well.","061":"So that is your story...","062":"Once Khury had been defeated, I intended to see my childhood friend Glaciela take the throne, and give my support as her strategist.","063":"I dreamed of this with my younger sister by my side, however...","064":"In order to realize your revenge now, you...","065":"I no longer feel even a slither of hope for the future of Wezette...","066":"Nor do I longer care for the happiness of its people.","067":"At least...that was my sentiment up until a time most recent.","068":"I cannot risk freeing you from your imprisonment at this time.","069":"I wish you well, Lord Schuzelt...","070":"W-wait...!
